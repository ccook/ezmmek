Description: ezmmek serves as a hub for published fluorometric enzyme assay
 protocols. ezmmek calibrates, calculates, and plots enzyme activities as they
 relate to the transformation of synthetic substrates. At present, ezmmek
 implements two common protocols in the literature, and is modular to accommodate
 additional protocols. Here, these protocols are referred to as the In-Sample
 Calibration (Hoppe, 1983) and In-Buffer Calibration (German et al., 2011).
 protocols. By containing multiple protocols, ezmmek aims to stimulate
 discussion about how to best optimize fluorometric enzyme assays. A standardized
 approach would make studies more comparable and reproducible.
